# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction:

This project analyzes the shopping habits of Instacart customers using a publicly released dataset. The dataset includes information on customer orders, purchased products, and more. The objective is to clean the data and extract insightful trends and patterns from customers' purchasing behaviors.

## Dataset Description:

The data consists of the following key files:

- instacart_orders.csv: Details each order placed on the Instacart app.
- products.csv: Contains unique product information available for purchase.
- order_products.csv: Lists individual items within each order.
- aisles.csv: Provides grocery aisle categories.
- departments.csv: Describes each grocery department category.

The dataset has been modified to include introduced missing and duplicate values, while preserving original data distributions.

## Objectives:

- Clean and preprocess the dataset by handling missing and duplicate values.
- Analyze and visualize purchase trends, such as order frequency by day, and customer order intervals.
- Identify top ordered and reordered products.

## Setup Instructions:

- Install Python 3.x and the necessary libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- Clone or download the project repository.
- Navigate to the project directory and open the analysis notebook.

## Usage: 

Run the Jupyter notebook to execute the analysis. The notebook includes detailed code cells with explanations, visualizations, and insights drawn from the dataset.

## Results:

Key findings include:

- Peak ordering times and popular ordering days.
- Most frequently ordered products.
- Patterns in reorder behavior among customers.

## Future Work:

- Extend the analysis to identify trends across different user demographics.
- Incorporate machine learning models to predict future purchases.
